This project has been created to understand the basics of reactive development using Spring web-flux.

### API Developers are using Reactive approach
#### http endpoints invocation:
1. Use [developer-requests.http](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fdeveloper-requests.http)
2. To edit response: [reactive-developers.json](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fresponse%2Freactive-developers.json)

### API Nasa picture
#### http endpoints invocation:
1. Override api key in [application.properties](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fapplication.properties)
2. Use [nasa-requests.http](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fnasa-requests.http)
